MAG Website & Content Specialist Take-HomeAssignment
Congratulations! You have advanced to the next round of the interview process.
Your assignment is to re-design the Transportation Studies main template. You have full
creative freedom to propose a modern, mobile-friendly, and engaging layout that is easy to
follow and visually consistent with the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG)
brand.

Objective

accessibly, and persuasively — while encouraging user interaction through multiple calls to
action.
Primary Goals:
• Inform the public about a planned transportation study.
• Encourage RSVPs for the in-person public meeting (primary call-to-action).
• Gather public feedback through a form (secondary call-to-action).
• Allow users to subscribe to email updates about the study.
• Include a button to view a downloadable PDF of the proposed study (placement
up to your discretion).
